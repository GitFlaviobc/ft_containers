<a name="intro"/> <h2> Intro </h2> </a>
- On this project I had to re implement the CPP container map and vector.
- Learned more about data structures like vector, pairs and maps.
- Learned about AVL Tree and RB Tree.
- Learned about using templates with type traits and metadata.
- Learned about iterators.

<a name="goal"/> <h2> 🎯 Goal </h2> </a>
- The goal is to learn C++ containers, how to use them and how they were implemented.
- After that re implement the containers I had to compare and test with the orignal containers to see if the performance was good and if the output were correct.
